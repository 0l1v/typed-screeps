# Usage 

Run command: 

```
$ npm install screeps-typescript-declarations --save
```

Include declaration file in your typescript compiler (usually tsconfig.json), "files" attribute.

```json
"files": ["./your_sources_folder/**/*.ts", "./node_modules/screeps-typescript-declarations/dist/screeps.d.ts"],
```

# Contribute

This library will stay up to date only with the help of you! If active players don't update it, it'll get lost.

To update the declarations, edit the files in ./src folder. 

To compile the declarations, run:

```
npm run compile
```

# Changelog

### v1.1.1 2016-02-05

- Updated all declarations. Everything should be quite close to Screep's API (with minor exceptions if I missed something accidentally)
